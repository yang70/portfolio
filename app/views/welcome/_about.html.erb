    <p>Welcome to my site!  I am a web developer currently enjoying the Ruby on Rails framework and am residing with my family in the greater Seattle area.  I am currently a student at <a href="http://www.codefellows.org">Code Fellows</a>, an intensive web dev/code school specializing in graduating hire-ready devolopers.  After ten years in my previous field I am looking for a career change and am puting in the time and effort to make that dream a reality for my family and myself.  Please feel free to <%= link_to "contact", '#contact' %> me for any reason!  Thank you!</p>
