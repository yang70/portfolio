    <h4>About</h4>
    <p>I am an aspiring web developer, specifically for the Ruby on Rails framework.  I am currently a student at <a href="http://www.codefellows.org">Code Fellows</a>, an intensive code school.  After ten years in my current field I am looking for a career change and am puting in the time and work to make my dream a reality.  Please feel free to <%= link_to "contact", '#' %> me for any reason!  Thank you!</p>
