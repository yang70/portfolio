    <h4>About</h4>
    <p>I am a web developer, specifically for the Ruby on Rails framework, who is currently living in the Seattle area.  I am a student at <a href="http://www.codefellows.org">Code Fellows</a>, an intensive web dev/code school.  After ten years in my previous field I am looking for a career change and am puting in the time and effort to make that dream a reality for my family and myself.  Please feel free to <%= link_to "contact", '#' %> me for any reason!  Thank you!</p>
