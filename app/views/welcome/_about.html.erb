    <p>Welcome!  My name is Matt and I am a web developer currently enjoying the Ruby on Rails framework and working to expand my knowledge base on a daily basis.  After ten years in my previous field I am looking for a career change and am putting in the time and effort to make that dream a reality for my family and for myself.  Please feel free to <%= link_to "contact", '#contact' %> me for any reason!  Thank you!</p>
